one of the features of the project is having no
external dependencies.

it has its own markdown-like markup language (parser),
which currently supports links, images, emphasized & strong text,
heading 1, heading 2, unordered & bullet lists.

it also generates an RSS/Atom feed.

adding support for code blocks to the parser is planned.
