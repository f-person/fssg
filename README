the project is not complete/usable yet.

one of it's features is having no dependencies.
it uses it's own markdown-like markup language (parser),
which currently supports links, emphasized & strong text,
heading 1, heading 2 and unordered lists.
adding support for code blocks and metadata is in plans.
